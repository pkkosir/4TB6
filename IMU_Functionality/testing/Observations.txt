Observations:

X1 is the best for tracking our movement (shin X direction).

X2 follows X1, but with slight delay. May be good for smoothing but we will see how numbers work out. 

Contact happens when there is a jolt, after the initial sinusoidal looking impact. The acceleration change goes to 0, X1 ~-5 and X2 ~0. Should hold for 10 samples of ~0 after we see high peak to detect weight acceptance. 

Y data generally useless, doesn't really move much. Has noticeable change at contact, but we don't really care

Z data likewise not overly useful

Peaks in X ALWAYS go above 25. When stationary even w/ noise will not go above generally. Can be used as threshold for high peak

Adding X1 and X2 does remove some subtractive noise. may be effective method of initial data cleaning

Since angle starts at 0, it takes a while to correct itself to 120. should change initial angle to 135 (between straight and bent leg, least amount of correction time hopefully). 

Above 140 for 5-10 samples SHOULD be sufficient for detecting that we're done using PID. Sufficient for ready to weight bear should be 10-15 samples
